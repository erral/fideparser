fideparser
===========

fideparser is a script to parse `FIDE Ratings website`_ and export the data
of the rated tournaments and their arbiters into another formats (currently
csv, json and an internally pickle-based format)

This scripts relies on `screen-scrapping`_ so if FIDE changes the HTML
the script will break :S

I intend to mantain this script, at least once a year to export data of the
previous year, so I will keep an eye on the FIDE site and try to fix the bugs.

Feel free to fork and ask for pull-requests. If you find any issue, use
`the issue tracker in GitHub`_.

Install and use
===================

Install using 'easy_install fideparser' or 'pip install fideparser'.
A script named 'export_fide_tournaments' will be created in your
bin directory in your path.

Run 'export_fide_tournaments -h' to know about the needed parameters.

This script has been tested with Python 2.7 in a Linux environment.
Windows platform is untested and I have no plan to test it. Patches welcomed.
